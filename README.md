# python2-sharpshooter
Script to install dependencies, etc for Sharpshooter to run on modern Linux installations. I ran into this issue when trying to use Sharpshooter with Python 3. It's supposed to work, but it doesn't. If you use this script, it will install git, curl, and python 2.7. It will download sharpshooter and the proper jsmin package, which it will also install. 

I'm not sure how many people use Sharpshooter these days, but I ran across it in my OSEP laboratory, and wanted to use it.
